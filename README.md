# Serverless Web Application on AWS

## Project Name: Serverless Web Application on AWS

### Project Description:

In this project, I am going to  build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table.

1.Designed and deployed a serverless web application on AWS, leveraging Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3 for CRUD operations.
2.Established a scalable DynamoDB table to store application data efficiently, ensuring reliability and scalability.
3.Developed Lambda functions to manage CRUD operations, providing seamless interaction with the DynamoDB database.
4.Utilized S3 to host static web content, enhancing availability and durability of the application's assets.
5.Improved proficiency in cloud computing and AWS services, demonstrating practical skills in serverless architecture and web application deployment.

### Project Architecture:

### Steps to Build the Project:

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items. \
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table. \
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). \
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency. \

### Expected Outcome:

Upon completing the project, you will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS. \
You will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront. \
Additionally, you will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project will help you improve your skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
